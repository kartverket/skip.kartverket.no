Admittedly, it was somewhat difficult to set up a realistic scenario without outright disabling some of our security tools, so in the end we simulated a hostile takeover of the user account belonging to the person responsible for planning and running the exercise.  The first sign that something was amiss was an alert from our Sysdig Secure toolset, a Falco-based agent software which continually monitors our cluster for signs of abnormal activity according to a predefined ruleset and provides a SaaS portal for further analysis and management of threats. (We will cover more of our security features and mechanisms and how we try to build a modern kubernetes based application platform with built-in security and zero trust in a future blog post.) After initial examination, we found that the incident was of such a nature that we engaged our crisis management plan in order to investigate, contain and mitigate the incident. We simulated communication with the organization-level crisis management team, having regular meetings in order to keep them informed of progress. Systematic examination of logs and audit logs soon turned up suspicious activity confined to one specific platform developer account, and the decision was made to immediately suspend (simulated in this case) the account, removing all access to organizational systems and in effect locking it out. Simultaneously, the malicious software was removed once enough evidence was secured in order to further analyze the actions and impact of it. The exercise was announced as ended once we suspended the compromised user account and removed the malicious application while retaining and analyzing enough logs, forensic captures and other traces of activity.

The incident itself was as follows: A software update or rogue script caused catastrophic hardware failure in production infrastructure, necessitating creation of a new Kubernetes cluster from scratch. Once the cluster itself and all underlying infrastructure had been created and configured, it would then be up to our platform team to deploy all necessary IAM configuration, service accounts, RBAC and supporting systems (Istio, ArgoCD ++) needed to deploy workloads and restore normal operations. The exercise itself focused on this second phase of restoration, as the infrastructure configuration and cluster creation itself is done by another team, with little involvement by our platform team members.  The failure itself was simulated by having our infrastructure team wipe our sandbox environment and present us with a clean-slate Kubernetes cluster. We called an all-hands meeting and set to work restoring services right away. Right at the onset, we recognized that this was a golden opportunity both to ensure that our documentation was up-to-date, consistent and easy to follow, as well as give our three newest team members some much-needed experience and insight into setting up our services from scratch. We therefore decided that the newest team members would be the ones to actually execute all the actions outlined in our documentation, while the rest of us followed along and made notes, updated documentation and otherwise provided guidance throughout the process.  The first run-through of the recovery process took around 2-3 hours before everything was in working order. Keep in mind that we took the time to update our documentation and explain everything we did while we were working, so in a real-life scenario this would have been even quicker. Once the IAM, RBAC, Istio and ArgoCD was up and running, it was merely a matter of using ArgoCD to synchronize and deploy all relevant workloads. Afterwards, we had a meeting to discuss the process and what experiences we gained from it. Based on the feedback from this meeting, we made further adjustments and updates to our documentation in order to make it even easier to follow on a step-by-step basis, focusing on removing any ambiguity and put any &quot;tribal&quot; knowledge among our platform developers into writing. This ensured that we are way less dependent on the knowledge and skillset of specific people, enabling any team member to contribute to recovery efforts by simply following the documentation.  The newest team members greatly enjoyed being responsible for the recovery effort itself, and expressed a wish to run through the scenario again in order to refine their skills and further improve the documentation. Therefore, we decided to set aside most of day 2 to do just that. We had the infrastructure team tear down and setup the cluster again, and let the newest team members loose on it - this time on their own without guidance - an additional two times. The last run-through of the exercise took between 30 and 60 minutes, a significant improvement from the initial attempt.  All in all, we considered the exercise to be a great success, with many important lessons learned and a substantial improvement in the quality of our documentation and crisis management plans.

This ensures that you avoid being dependent upon key personnel that might or might not be available during a crisis scenario, and also ensures that you retain vital institutional knowledge even when team members move on to different tasks or even new jobs.

Oh, and monitoring too!​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Crisis Management Exercises","url":"/blog/crisis-management-exercises#lesson-2-logging-logging-logging-oh-and-monitoring-too","content":" Having the ability to search through logs of all parts of our system greatly simplifies any incident management, whether the incident revolved around malicious actors or other factors. But logs by themselves are not sufficient - you need some sort of monitoring and alerting system in order to alert on and react to abnormal situations/behaviour in your systems. Ideally, you should be able to react on these alerts instead of messages from users - or worse, customers - that something is wrong.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Lesson 3: Test your plans!​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Crisis Management Exercises","url":"/blog/crisis-management-exercises#lesson-3-test-your-plans","content":" Merely having plans, routines and documentation is insufficient. Unless they have been thoroughly tested and their quality assured through crisis exercises in realistic scenarios and conditions, they should be treated as flawed and unreliable until the opposite is proven. Running crisis management exercises is a great way to expose flaws, insufficiencies and outdated documentation, and careful note-taking and postmortems should be the norm throughout the exercise in order to easily identify and update weak spots in your plans and documentation. As systems and circumstances change, so should plans and documentation too in order to reflect the new order of the day.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Lesson 4: Communicate!​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Crisis Management Exercises","url":"/blog/crisis-management-exercises#lesson-4-communicate","content":" Openness and communication is critical during both exercises and real-world crisis scenarios. Plans should always involve key points of communication - who needs to be informed, whose responsibility it is to keep said people informed, and the frequency, scope and format of information to disseminate. This also applies to communication afterwards. Anyone in your organization should be able to understand what happened, how it was solved and what lessons were learned from it. In Kartverket, we solve this by writing postmortems about incidents, summing up the incident itself and what we learned from it. We favour Blameless Postmortems, enabling us to quickly and thoroughly analayze and document all aspects of an incident without focusing on individual mistakes and avoid passing blame. This contributes to a culture of openness, learning and improvement. Hoarding information and disseminating it only on a &quot;need-to-know&quot; basis only breeds distrust and contempt, as does a culture that focuses on blaming and punishing people for mistakes instead of learning from them. A further bonus when communicating the happenings and results of your crisis management exercises is the potential to inspire others - when people see the great results and lessons you yourselves have gained from such exercises, they might want to try it with their own systems and teams.

It is also a great confidence booster, because if they succeed, they'll gain valuable insight and positive experiences with setting up all those scary critical systems from scratch - and if they don't succeed, well, that's not their fault, it was because the documentation and training was insufficent to enable them to handle the situation!

We wanted to use existing underlying VMware infrastructure, so the nodes in our clusters are VMs, provisioned by scripts provided by Google. Our cluster is installed withkubeceptioncontrolplane architechture, this no longer the only, or recommended way. The recommended model is Controlplane V2, where the controlplane nodes for the user cluster are in the user cluster itself.  In the kubeception model, Kubernetes clusters are nested inside other Kubernetes clusters. Specifically, the control plane of the user clusters runs in an admin-cluster. For each on-premise cluster created, a new set of nodes and a namespace are created in the admin cluster.  To install and make changes to the admin cluster, an admin workstation is required, which must be located in the same network as the admin cluster. All configurations are done using a CLI tool called gkectl. This tool handles most cluster administration tasks, and the cluster specific configuration is provided in YAML files.  Our cluster setup is more or less static, and most cluster administration tasks involve upgrading or scaling existing clusters. The SKIP team has a cluster referred to as “sandbox”, which is always the first recipient of potentially breaking changes. After testing in sandbox, we'll deploy changes to both development and test environments, and if nothing breaks, we roll out the changes to our production environment. This is mostly done outside work-hours, although we have not experienced downtime during cluster upgrades. Here is the general workflow for upgrading:  Upgrade your admin workstation to the target version of your upgrade.From your admin workstation, upgrade your user clusters.After all of the user clusters have been upgraded, you can upgrade your admin cluster from the admin workstation.  We have tried using Terraform where possible to simplify the setup. This can not be done in the same way for clusters using the kubeception model. When we migrate to Controlplane V2 however, clusters can be managed via GCP, and we can finally start using terraform for our on-premise cluster config in the same way as for our GKE clusters, and GCP configuration in general.

This was not a huge problem for us, since we were working with a very limited number of teams and devs, but it was apparent that this was not going to scale well. Luckily we got support for groups before it was a problem, and our config files went from containing way too many names and email addresses, to only containing groups.  Our Google Workspace receives groups and users from our Microsoft Active Directory. Groups are initially created either in Entra ID, or on our local Domain Controllers, and at set intervals changes are pushed to Google Workspace.Role-based access control (RBAC) based on membership in these groups was needed. We wanted to manage this through Terraform, and created a repo with where we store and configure our entire IAM configuration. Since we have had growing adoption of Kubernetes and public cloud in our organization, more teams, projects and apps have been onboarded to SKIP, and this IAM repo has grown. We've tried to simplify the structure more than once, but since this is a problem not affecting dev teams, we have chosen to prioritize other tasks.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Workloads​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Hybrid Kubernetes in production pt. 2","url":"/blog/hybrid-kubernetes-in-production-part-2#workloads","content":" All clusters created in in Anthos can be viewed from the GCP console, and theConnect gatewaymakes it possible to do management from the console (or via kubectl) as well. The GCP console can be used to get information about, or manage the state of the cluster, workloads and resources present. This is a web GUI, part of the GCP console, and not as snappy as cli-tools, but still usable, and intuitive to use.  This view shows workloads running in the argocd namespace. All workloads displayed here can be clicked, and explored further.  When accessing the cluster via the Connect gateway there are some limits. The Connect gateway does not handle persistent connections, and this makes it impossible to do exec, port-forward, proxy or attach. This is not a problem for a production environment, where containers should never be used in this way. But for a dev, or sandbox environment, this is a bit of a pain-point.  This issue should be partially fixed in Kubernetes 1.29 and should be completely resolved in Kubernetes 1.30.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Service Mesh​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Hybrid Kubernetes in production pt. 2","url":"/blog/hybrid-kubernetes-in-production-part-2#service-mesh","content":" A Service Mesh in Kubernetes is an infrastructure layer that manages communication between services. We are using Anthos Service Mesh (ASM), which is based on Istio and nicely integrated with the GCP console. It's easy to get an overview of services, the connection between them, and what services are connected to either our internal or external gateways. This can be displayed in a Topology view, or if you click on a service, you'll get a more detailed drilldown.  A snippet of services running in our sandbox cluster.  When we deploy services to our cluster we create almost all Kubernetes and service-mesh resources with our custom operator;Skiperator. This operator configures the resources to fit our setup, and applies &quot;best practices&quot; the easy way. This has been one of the great success stories in SKIP, and Skiperator is in continuous development.

As a platform team, it is our job to make sure that deployment is as quick and convenient as possible for the product teams. This ambition has led us to iterate on our processes, which has finally led us to a solution that both we and the developers enjoy using.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Iteration 1 - Terraform​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Hybrid Kubernetes in production pt. 2","url":"/blog/hybrid-kubernetes-in-production-part-2#iteration-1---terraform","content":" When we first started out with Anthos, we had a very manual process for deploying applications. A service account was provisioned in GCP, which allowed the developers to impersonate a service account in Kubernetes, which in turn allowed them to deploy apps using Terraform. This approach worked, but had a decent amount of rough edges, and also would fail in ways that was hard to debug.  With this approach the developers would have to manage their own Terraform files, which most of the time was not within their area of expertise. And while SKIP was able to build modules and tools to make this easier, it was still a complex system that was hard to understand. Observability and discoverability was also an issue.  Because of this we would consistently get feedback that this way of deploying was too complicated and slow, in addition handling Terraform state was a pain. As a platform team we're committed to our teams' well being, so we took this seriously and looked at alternatives. This was around the time we adopted Anthos, so thus Anthos Config Managment was a natural choice.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Iteration 2 - Anthos Config Managment (ACM)​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Hybrid Kubernetes in production pt. 2","url":"/blog/hybrid-kubernetes-in-production-part-2#iteration-2---anthos-config-managment-acm","content":"   ACM is a set of tools that allows you to declaratively manage your Kubernetes resources. Here we're mostly going to talk about Config Sync, which is aGitOps system for Kubernetes.  In a GitOps system, a team will have a Git repository that contains all the Kubernetes resources that they want to deploy. This repository is then synced to the Kubernetes cluster, and the resources are applied.  This can be likened to a pull-based system, where the GitOps tool (Config sync) watches the repo for changes and pulls them into the cluster. This is in contrast to a push-based system, where a script pushes the changes to a cluster. It is therefore a dedicated system for deployment to Kubernetes, and following the UNIX philosophywhich focuses on doing that one thing well.  Using this type of a workflow solves a lot of the issues around the Terraform based deployment that we had in the previous iteration. No longer do developers need to set up a complicated integration with GCP service accounts and impersonation, committing a file to a Git repo will trigger a deployment. The Git repo and the manifests in them also works as a state of truth for the cluster, instead of having to reverse engineer what was deployed based on terraform diffs and state.    It started well, however we soon ran into issues. The system would often take a long time to reconcile the sync, and during the sync we would not have any visibility into what was happening. This was not a deal breaker, but at the same time this was not a particularly good developer experience.  We also ran into issues with implementing a level of self-service that we were satisfied with. We wanted to give the developers the ability to provision their own namespaces, but due to the multi-tenant nature of our clusters we also had to make sure that teams were not able to write to each others' namespaces. This was not a feature we were able to implement, but luckily our next iteration had this built in, and we'll get back to that.  The final nail was the user interface. We simply expected more from a deployment system than what ACM was able to provide. The only view into the deployment was a long list of resources, which to a developer that is not an expert in Kubernetes, was not intuitive enough.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Final iteration - Argo CD​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Hybrid Kubernetes in production pt. 2","url":"/blog/hybrid-kubernetes-in-production-part-2#final-iteration---argo-cd","content":"   This finally brought us to our current iteration. We had heard about Argo CD before, but initially we were hesitant to add another system to our stack. After ACM had introduced us to GitOps and we looked deeper into Argo CD, it was obvious to us that Argo was more mature and would give our developers a better user experience.  The killer feature here is the UI. Argo CD has an intuitive and user-friendly UI that gives the developers a good overview of what is deployed. Whenever anything fails, it's immediately obvious which resource is failing, and Argo allows you to drill down into the resource to see the details of the failure, logs for deployments, Kubernetes events, etc.    The above photo illustrates this well. Here you can see a project with a number of Skiperator applications. The green checkmarks indicate that the application is synced and the green heart indicates that the application is healthy. A developer can see the underlying &quot;owned&quot; resources that Skiperator creates (such as a deployment, service, etc), and get a look &quot;behind the curtain&quot; to see what is actually deployed. This helps debugging and gives the developers a better insight into what is happening during a deployment.  In terms of multi tenancy, Argo CD has a concept of projects. A project is a set of namespaces that a team has access to, and a team can only use Argo to sync to namespaces that are part of their project. The namespace allowlist can also include wildcards, which sounds small but this solved our self-service issue! With our apps-repo architecture, we would give a team a &quot;prefix&quot; (for example seeiendom-), and that team would then be able to deploy to and create any namespace that started with that prefix. If they tried to deploy to another team's namespace they would be stopped, as they would not have access to that prefix.  The prefix feature allows product teams to create a new directory in their apps repo, which will then be synced to the cluster and deployed as a new namespace. This is a very simple and intuitive workflow for creating short-lived deployments, for example for pull requests, and it has been very well received by the developers.  The apps-repo architecture will be a blog post itself at some point, so I won't go too much into it.  And finally, if you're wondering what disaster recovery of an entire cluster looks like with Argo CD, I leave you with the following video at the end.    ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Hybrid Mesh​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Hybrid Kubernetes in production pt. 2","url":"/blog/hybrid-kubernetes-in-production-part-2#hybrid-mesh","content":" A hybrid mesh service mesh configuration is a setup that allows for service networking across different environments. For Kartverket this includes a hybrid cloud environment. The setup involves several steps, including setting up cross-cluster credentials, installing the east-west gateway, enabling endpoint discovery, and configuring certificate authorities. All clusters in a hybrid mesh are registered to the same fleet host project, and istiod in each cluster must be able to communicate with the Kube-API on the opposing clusters.  ASM is as previously mentioned based on Istio, and after some internal discussion we decided to experiment with running vanilla upstream Istio in our GKE clusters running in GCP. Pairing it with ASM in our on-premise clusters worked as expected (after a bit of config), and we are now running upstream Istio in GKE, with ASM on-prem in a multi-cluster setup. We also looked into using managed ASM in our GKE cluster, this was hard for us however, due to it requiring firewall openings on-prem for sources we could not predict.    We have chosen the Multi-Primary on different networksafter reviewing our network topology and configuration. We connect our on-premise network, with the GCP VPC through a VPN connection (using host and service projects). To have a production ready environment, the VPN connection must be configured with redundancy.  We're working towards getting this architecture into production, as this will enable us to seamlessly use GKE clusters in GCP together with our on-premise clusters. The elasticity of cloud infrastructure can be utilized where needed, and we can handle communication between services on different clusters much more smoothly. This has been a bit of a journey to configure, but as a learning experience it has been valuable. Being able to address services seamlessly and communicate with mTLS enabled by default across sites, zones and clusters without developers having to think about it feels a bit like magic.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Monitoring​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Hybrid Kubernetes in production pt. 2","url":"/blog/hybrid-kubernetes-in-production-part-2#monitoring","content":" ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Google Cloud Monitoring​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Hybrid Kubernetes in production pt. 2","url":"/blog/hybrid-kubernetes-in-production-part-2#google-cloud-monitoring","content":"   GKE Enterprise includes an agent that collects metrics from the cluster and sends them to Google Cloud. This is a great feature which makes it relatively easy to get started with metrics and monitoring. However, we have decided not to use the agent, and instead use Grafana and LGTM for metrics and monitoring.  This is mainly due to a couple of challenges:  The amount of metrics that are collected out of the box and sent to GCP contributes a significant part of our total spend. It's not that we have a lot of clusters, but the amount of metrics that are collected out of the box is very high, and Anthos' default setup didn't give us the control we needed to be able to manage it in a good way.  Note that this was before Managed Service for Prometheus was released with more fine grained control over what metrics are collected. It is now the recommended default, which should make metrics collection easier to manage.  Second, while Google Cloud Monitoring has a few nice dashboards ready for Anthos, it feels inconsistent which dashboards work on-premise and which only work in cloud as they are not labeled as such. This is not a big issue, but it's a bit annoying. The bigger issue is that all the dashboards feel sluggish and slow to load. Several of us have used Grafana before, so we're used to a snappy and responsive UI. In our opinion, Google Cloud Monitoring feels clunky in comparison.  So the cost and the user experience were the main reasons we decided to look at alternatives to Google Cloud Monitoring. We ended up using Grafana and LGTM, which we'll talk about next.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Grafana with the LGTM stack​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Hybrid Kubernetes in production pt. 2","url":"/blog/hybrid-kubernetes-in-production-part-2#grafana-with-the-lgtm-stack","content":"   When we realized that our needs were not entirely met by Google Cloud Monitoring, we started a project to develop a monitoring stack that would meet our needs. Since Grafana is open source and has a large community, we decided to use that as our frontend. Our backend is the LGTM stack, which is a set of open source tools that are designed to work well together for ingesting, storing and querying logs, traces and metrics.  What we noticed immediately was that the product teams were much more engaged with this stack than they were with Google Cloud Monitoring. Previously they would not really look at the dashboards, but now they are using them and even creating their own. This is a huge win for us, as we want the teams to be engaged with the monitoring and observability of their services.  It definitely helps that most developers on the product teams are familiar with Grafana, which makes it easier for them to get started as the learning curve is not as steep.  There was a discussion about what the backend should be, if we should useGrafana Cloud or host it ourselves. There would be a lot of benefits of using the cloud, as we would not have to maintain the stack or worry about performance or storage. There was, however, a concern about cost and whether or not log files could be shipped to a cloud provider. In the end we decided to host it ourselves, mostly because we didn't have control over what quantities of data we're processing. Now that we have a better understanding of our usage we can use that to calculate our spend, so we're not ruling out migrating to Grafana Cloud in the future.  The collection (scraping) of data is done by Grafana Agent, which is an &quot;all-in-one&quot; agent that collects metrics, logs and traces. This means a few less moving parts for the stack, as we don't have to run both Prometheus,Fluent Bit and someOpenTelemetry compatible agent for traces. It's a relatively new project, but it's already relative stable and has a lot of features. It uses a funky format for configuration called river, which is based on Hashicorp's HCL. The config enables forming pipelines to process data before it's forwarded to Loki, Tempo or Mimir. It's a bit different, but it works well and is easy to understand and configure to our needs.    Using a system like Grafana also enables us to build an integrated experience that also includes alerting. Using Grafana alerting and OnCall, we configure alerts that are sent to the correct team based on the service that is failing. This helps the teams get a better overview of what is happening in their services, and also helps us as a platform team to not have to be involved in every alert that is triggered.  Overall we're very happy with the LGTM stack, even though it's a fair bit of work to maintain the stack (especially with Istio and other security measures). We're also happy with Grafana, and we're looking forward to seeing what the future holds for monitoring and observability in Kubernetes.

As a platform team we look at each feature on a case-by-case basis, with the goal of giving our developers the best possible experience instead of naively trying to use as much as possible of the platform. Because of this we've decided to use Anthos for Kubernetes and service mesh, but not for config sync and monitoring. This has given us a great platform that we're confident will serve us well for years to come.

While this is possible to do for an existing system, in practice it will mean a lot of work to get to the point where you're able to enforce these standards. It's much easier to start with a clean slate.  For our platform, we decided on a set of principles that we wanted to follow. Some of these are:  Stateless: Our clusters are stateless, which means that we can easily replace them if something goes wrong. All configuration is held in a GitOps repository and all state is held in external systems like managed databases, object storage, etc. This significantly reduces operational complexity and recovery time. If a cluster fails we can easily replace or revert it by applying the configuration from the GitOps repository without worrying about losing state, or doing time-consuming data recovery operations.Ownership: For each application, there is a clear owner. This owner is responsible for the application and maintains and supports it. This way we're able to avoid the &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot;, where no one is responsible for an application. If an app has unclear or short-term ownership, you simply don't get to use the platform. We're not an orphanage.Financing: You use the platform? You also need to pay for its continued support and development. We're working towards a chargeback model where your department is billed for the resources they use as a way to ensure that the platform is sustainable. Until this is ready, we expose the costs of the resources used by each team and then negotiate with the departments on how to cover these costs, but this is time-consuming work.Secure by default: We enforce security best practices by default. Examples of this are zero trust networking with Network Policies, where no app can talk to another without explicitly allowing this. Some applications will need to opt out of some of these defaults, and they can do so by altering their configuration. But the defaults are secure, which is especially useful for teams that are new to Kubernetes.  All teams that are onboarded on SKIP are given an introduction to these principles and are expected to follow them. This means that being able to use the modern platform is contingent on the teams being able to prioritize modernizing their applications and working in sustainable ways, which helps push for positive change.

We're always happy to help, but we also have a heavy workload of exciting things we're working on. Therefore it's much better when platform users can help each other, as this facilitates collaboration and learning. This is why we highly encourage teams to help each other out - to build a community around the platform.  In practice this is done through a single Slack channel where all teams that are using the platform are invited. This is a great place to ask questions, share experiences, and learn from each other - and it's a place where all new features and changes are announced. We used to have many different channels for different teams, but we found that this was not as effective for building a community as a channel where everyone can help each other out.  And a final tip: As a platform developer, sometimes it's better to wait a little while before responding to questions in these channels to allow the community to help each other out before you jump in and help.

This is why it's important to set aside time for innovation, this is something we take very seriously.  On SKIP we have dedicated innovation days where we work on new features, improvements, and other things that we think will make the platform better. This is an extraordinarily successful initiative, and we've seen many great features come out of these days. It's also a great way to build team morale and to build a culture of learning and innovation.  In practice we have two days in a row of dedicated innovation work every other month. We used to have one day every month, but we found that this was not enough time to really get into the flow of things so we started doing two days every 2 months, which worked better. We also have a rule that you can't work on anything that's on the roadmap, as this is work that we're already going to do. This is a great way to get new ideas and to work on things that might not otherwise get done.    There's a little bit of structure around these days, but not too much.  First, it is understood by everyone that these days are for things that are &quot;useful for Kartverket&quot;. This means that you can't work on your own pet project, but it's vague enough that you can work on pretty much anything that you think will be useful for the organization.  Then, a week before the innovation day we will have a &quot;pitching session&quot;, where everyone who has an idea can pitch it to the rest of the team. This is a great way to get feedback on your idea and to get others to join you in working on it.  Finally, we have a &quot;show and tell&quot; session at the end of the last day where everyone shows what they've been working on. This way we can share our experiences and discuss if this work can be improved and put into production. We encourage everyone to show something, even if it's not finished or you did video lessons, as this creates discussion and further ideas.    There's plenty of examples of features that are results of work done on these days. On-premise Web Application Firewall with Wasm, Grafana features, open source tools like Skiperator andSkyline as well as this very website!

This is a mistake. Communication is key to building a successful platform.  Your users exist in the context of all the platform features that you have shipped and the changes you will ship in the future. Not informing them and keeping them up to date with what's going on is a surefire way to lose their trust and to make them unhappy.  It starts with simply informing users of the new features that ship. This can be done through a Slack channel, a newsletter, a blog or a town hall meeting. We use a combination of all of these, but the most important thing is that you inform your users of what's coming. An added benefit of this is helps push adoption of new features and excitement around the platform by showcasing innovation.  The next step is informing users on what will ship and when. This will help users plan their work and to know what to expect, but it also helps users feel involved when they see their requests being planned. This can be done through a roadmap, a technical forum, or a blog. We use a combination of all of these, but the easiest way to do this is to have a roadmap that you keep up to date on a regular basis.  Now for the hard part: When things go wrong, you need to communicate this as well. Product teams will want to know when their applications are affected by outages or other issues, and they will want to know what you're doing to fix it. This can be done through a status page, a Slack channel, or postmortems. Again, we use a mix of these so that we can reach as many users as possible at the right time.

Do you think Apple would be as successful if it was called &quot;Computer Company&quot;? Of course not. Branding is important. It builds a sense of identity and community around your platform.  This is especially important for a platform team, as you're not just building a product, you're building a community. You want your users to feel like they're part of something bigger, and you want them to feel excited to use the platform.  When you're starting out, you want to drive adoption. Here a brand really helps as it's easier to talk about a good brand in a positive way. It's also easier to get leadership buy-in when you have a strong brand.  This holds true when you're more established as well. When you grow larger than your ability to talk to everyone, a brand helps you communicate your values and intent to your users, which will drive organic growth from teams that want to work with you.  A minimum viable brand is a logo, a name, and a color scheme. This is something you should think deeply about, as it's something that will stick with you for a long time. After this you can think about a website, merchandise like stickers and t-shirts, and a mascot. These things are not necessary, but they can help build a sense of identity and community around your platform.

This generally means using public cloud solutions like Google Cloud Platform. But for most organizations, pushing this narrative incurs significant friction and to some extent fear due to legal and cost concerns. This is understandable, as the known is always more comfortable than the unknown, and it's a view that's hard to change.  This is why it's important to take a long-term view on this. You're not going to move everything to the cloud overnight, and you're not going to convince everyone to get on board with this idea overnight. It's a long journey, and you need to be patient and persistent.  We've spent years pushing for the cloud, and we're still not there. You're going to have to participate in many (many!) meetings, and you're going to have to fight for every little thing over and over again. But it's necessary. Once everyone has a clear understanding of the risks and how to mitigate them, you will be able to formulate a document guiding the organization's teams on how to get to the cloud from a compliance point of view.  If you asked me for any recommendations on how to get to the cloud as easily as possible, it would be to first get leadership buy-in across the organization. This is important, as it will make any large initiative like cloud migration easier. After this and a competent platform team is in place, you can start pushing for the cloud technologies and eventually cloud migration. Here you need to talk directly with the legal team, not via other people. Have representatives of the platform team sit down with the lawyers and talk through the risks and how to mitigate them.

This means continuously improving your product, listening to your users, and building the features that they need.  Research-based literature like &quot;Team Topologies&quot; establishes the importance of autonomous teams in modern organizations. Traditional top-down organizations are just not going to be able to have as close of a relationship with their stakeholders as a team that is able to proactively understand the needs of their users and make their own decisions that push continuous improvement of their products. This is why it's important, even for infrastructure teams, to be able to own their roadmap and make decisions on what to build when.  As a team you're obviously limited to the amount of resources you have and not able to do everything, so understanding the needs of your stakeholders and prioritizing them is essential. You need to do research to know the needs of your users; sometimes requests don't align well with the actual needs. Just because someone asks loudly for something, doesn't mean it's the right fit for your platform. Saying yes to everything does not result in a good product.

But it really can't be said enough. The better the tooling you provide, the less you have to do support. This is a win-win for everyone.  When building tools, think about how you can abstract away complexity. This can be done in many ways, but we've had great success building an operator that abstracts away the complexity of managing applications on Kubernetes. The operator is called Skiperator and makes deploying applications on Kubernetes as easy as writing a configuration manifest.  apiVersion: skiperator.kartverket.no/v1alpha1 kind: Application metadata: namespace: sample name: sample-two spec: image: nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged port: 80 replicas: 2 ingresses: - foo.com - bar.com   The key takeaway here is that abstractions like Skiperator are designed to speak the language of the user. There is no mention of NetworkPolicies or Istio VirtualServices in the configuration, as these are things that the user generally doesn't have any knowledge of. Instead, the user can specify things like &quot;I want to expose this service to the internet&quot; or &quot;I want to run this job every day at midnight&quot;. This simplifies the user experience of Kubernetes, which is a complex system, and makes it easier for users to get started.  Work smarter not harder.

Just recently we asked our users to migrate their apps from one cluster to another in order to improve the architecture of the platform. Multiple options were considered, but in the end the scale of the changes meant that upgrading the clusters in-place would not be practical, so we commissioned new clusters with the new architecture and asked users to migrate their apps.  In our case, we had a simple way to migrate, only requiring moving a config file from one directory to another to make the change. But even so, this was a time consuming process for our users, and a laborious process for us to support. This is because even though the change was simple, it was still a change that required testing and validation, and it was a change that was not necessarily the highest priority for the teams that were asked to make it. So even though the change was simple, it took months.  If you ask your users to make changes to their applications, you're asking a team that is already busy to do more work. Any changes you ask them to make will take time, as it would not necessarily be the highest priority for them. Therefore avoiding breaking changes should be a primary goal, so wherever possible building in forward and backwards compatibility by inferring as much as possible from the existing configuration is a good thing.  When building operators, don't change or remove fields that are in use. Use default values for new fields, and use lists of objects instead of raw values like lists of strings as they are easier to extend.

This is understandable. When you're using a platform, you don't want to have to ask for help all the time - you want to be able to discover platform features and implement them yourself with the support of good documentation.  The point here is that as a platform team you need to prioritize documentation. A task is not done until it has been documented. This way announcing new features will always include a link to the documentation where users can dive deeper into the feature and how to use it, like the example below.    The bigger challenge here is preventing documentation from going stale. It's too easy to forget about updating documentation to reflect changes in the code. Here we can share a few tips from our experience:  First, the obvious way to keep docs up to date is to allocate time to update them. One way we do this is that a few times a year we will do a documentation grooming session where we huddle together and review documentation, rewriting it when we find out of date information.  A more interesting way to keep docs up to date is changing how you respond to questions. Instead of answering questions immediately, we should be asking ourselves: &quot;How can we make sure that this question never gets asked again?&quot;. In our case we spend some time to write documentation or improve existing documentation and reply with a link to the documentation page. This is a triple win, as you will now have more updated documentation, save time in the future by being able to refer to the improved docs instead of writing a lengthy response and the user will now know where to look for answers.

You might discuss how to implement a feature with your team, but you might not have the experience to know what works well in this context. When you get into this situation, an outside perspective can be crucial to avoid making costly mistakes.  One great advantage of working in the public sector is that we can ask other public sector platform teams for advice and learn from their experiences. We can also share our experiences with others, which is usually interesting. Invest some time in building these relationships of mutual benefit.    I also want to give special credit to Hans Kristian Flaatten and the Public PaaS network here. Having a shared forum to discuss platform issues is a strong asset and helps the Norwegian public sector get ahead and stay competitive.  Even if you work in the private sector, you can still learn from other organizations. Honestly, if you want to learn from someone's experiences it never hurts to ask. Teams generally want to help each other out, and it's usually possible to make a trade of some sort. I suggest to offer to give a talk on your experiences and ask if they can do the same.

This knowledge served us well, but also slightly held us back in terms of our imagination. We knew that there had to be a better way, but our enterprise was simply not mature enough to adopt a pure cloud strategy. The fear of the unknown cloud weighed heavily on many people, and therefore few people wanted to take the risk of moving to the cloud.  This is something we've worked on for a long time, and still are. After a long time of working with the stakeholders in the organization, we eventually built a cloud strategy, which in simple terms stated that we would prefer SaaS-products over hosting things ourselves, and that we would gradually move our workloads to the cloud.  This cloud strategy however, which cleared up a lot of blockers, came too late for us on SKIP. At that point we had already done most of the work on our on-premise platform, building on the assumptions the organization held at the time, which was that we met our needs through existing infrastructure and that using public cloud had disqualifying cost and compliance implications. For SKIP it was therefore full steam ahead, building the on-prem part first, then adding the hybrid and cloud part later.  It's not like we would have ended up with a pure cloud setup in any case, though. If you're at all familiar with large enterprises, you will know that they are often very complex. This is also true for Kartverket, where we have a lot of existing systems that are not easy to move to the cloud. We also have a lot of systems that are not suitable for the cloud, mostly because they are designed to run in a way that would not be cost effective in the cloud. In addition we have absolutely massive datasets (petabyte-scale) that would be very expensive to move to the cloud.  Because of these limitations, a pure cloud strategy is not considered to be a good fit for us.  A hybrid cloud, however, can give us the scalability and flexibility of the cloud, while still allowing us to run some of our systems on-prem, with the experience being more or less seamless for the developers.

Once we felt we had learned what we could from the PoC, we gathered thoughts from the product team, infrastructure team and of course the SKIP platform team.  The results were unanimous. All the participants lauded the GCP user interfaces that allowed visibility into running workloads, as well as the new self-service features that came with it.

This came from all sides of the organization, so this was taken as a given. SKIP was therefore started as a project to build an on-premise Kubernetes platform to service our needs as a transition to cloud native development principles.  As we moved along, a lot of these assumptions got challenged. We found that most of these assumptions were based on misunderstandings or a lack of a deeper understanding of cloud technologies and the surrounding legal aspects. This led to a fear of the unknown, and subsequent inaction. In the end it turned out that quite a lot of our workloads could indeed run in the public cloud, given some minor adjustments.  Had we started out with the knowledge we have now, we would probably have started with a public cloud provider, and then moved to hybrid when and if we saw a need for it. Using a cloud provider's managed Kubernetes offering is significantly easier than running your own, and you can get started much faster, with less risk.  Given our organization, we would probably have ended up with hybrid anyway, but that complexity could potentially have been moved down the timeline to a point where the platform was more mature.  Starting with hybrid is a massive undertaking, and you should have a good reason for doing so. Do you need hybrid, or do you just need to mature your organization? If you do, reduce the scope of the initial work to get to a workable platform, and preferably start in the cloud, adding hybrid features later. If you're not sure, you probably don't need hybrid.

Our experience is that this makes it easier for the organization to mature legacy workloads.  All our greenfield projects are written with cloud native principles in mind, which makes it trivial to run them in the cloud. Legacy workloads, however, are not so lucky. They are often written with a lot of assumptions about the underlying infrastructure and are not cognizant of the resources they use. This means they are a poor fit to lift and shift to the cloud, as they will often be expensive and inefficient.  With a hybrid platform, we can use our on-premise offering as a spring board for modernization. Product teams will start by shifting their app to our on-premise Kubernetes platform, and then gradually modernize it to be cloud native. This method gives a few immediate benefits from the lift and shift like better observability, developer experience and security features but also gives fewer of the drawbacks, as the on-premise cloud is closer to the existing dependencies than a public cloud. Once this is done, smaller chunks kan be rewritten as microservices and moved to the cloud, communicating with the monolith seamlessly over the hybrid network. This is sometimes referred to as the strangler application.  This method significantly reduces the scope of refactoring, as one can focus on gradually rewriting smaller modules instead of rewriting the entire application.

Starting from nothing with a goal of providing a secure-by-default zero-trust network layer with observability and traffic control is quite an undertaking, especially when you pair that with setting up a new kubernetes-based infrastructure from scratch. Istio is famously complex, and we've had our fair share of that.  So how do we feel about Istio? There are various opinions in the team, but if we average them all out, we're content. It's quite complex and can be hard to debug, but it does the job. As we've matured and gotten more experience with Istio, we've also started to see more benefits, like extensions for handling OAuth2and the traffic control features for gradual rollouts which we used for canary-testing the migration of some of our larger applications to SKIP. Not all of these features, like EnvoyFilters, are supported by Anthos Service Mesh (ASM), which is why we're exploring using upstream Istio instead of ASM.  One thing we quickly learned is to not let the product teams configure the service mesh directly using service mesh resources. This is a recipe for disaster. We tried this in the beginning, and first of all it's a huge complexity burden for the product teams. We also started getting a lot of weird issues when product teams would configure the mesh in ways that broke their encapsulation. Since the service mesh is a cluster-wide feature, if one team makes an invalid configuration, it can break other teams' workloads. Kubernetes namespaces be damned. We've therefore moved to a model where the platform team provides an abstraction throughSkiperator which configures the service mesh on their behalf.  Finally, I think it's prudent to ask yourself wether or not you actually need a service mesh. If you're running a small cluster with a few services, you'll probably be fine with using the built-in Kubernetes features like Ingress and Network Policies. The observability features are nice, but you can get most of them with a combination of instrumentation and Grafana.  If you need service mesh then limit the scope until you get comfortable with the mesh, for example start with just mTLS and observability, and then add zero trust networking features later.  Also keep in mind there is a lot of competition in the service mesh space, and there are some interesting alternatives to Istio, likeLinkerd and the up-and-coming Cilium Service Mesh.

I think a lot of teams will be in a similar situation, and this is where a managed service like Anthos can be a huge help. Anthos is built with best practices in mind, so a lot of the architecture decisions were built-in to the installer. Choosing a managed offering, even when running on-prem has therefore helped us deliver value to the product teams much quicker than if we had to build everything from scratch.  What's important to point out is that choosing something that is managed does not rule out using open source components later. We started out using all the parts that Anthos gave us, including service mesh, logging, monitoring and configuration management. Managed services do come with some tradeoffs, however, as you lose some of the finer control of the platform. As the team has matured and gained experience, we've started to replace some of these components with open source alternatives, which has helped us save money and gain more control over our platform. This has the downside of having to maintain these components ourselves, but with more experience in the team, this is a tradeoff we feel is worth it.  Even though we're increasingly using more open source components, we don't regret using a paid managed offering in the beginning. It helped us get started and make the right decisions early on, and we're now in a position where we can capitalize on that great start.

When we started out, we appreciated the simplicity of SaaS products that billed per node, as it made it easy to predict costs. We could simply look at the number of nodes we had running and multiply that with the price per node to get a relatively accurate estimate of what this offering would cost. This would turn out to be a double edged sword, however.  It is safe to assume that one of the reasons people choose Kubernetes is the ability to scale workloads easily. This could be scaling up to handle more traffic, or scaling down to save money. This is a great feature, but as the number of workloads grow, the provisioned nodes will start to become insufficient and new nodes will be provisioned. With Kubernetes and Anthos on VMware this can be done automatically, which is a fantastic feature.  The problem arises when you scale out more nodes and have a static license that bills per node. We've made the mistake of getting contracts with two (now just one) SaaS providers where we order a set of nodes, let's say 10, and when workloads scale up, we end up with more than 10 nodes. This means we're not running that SaaS-service's agents on the new nodes, which can be anything from inconvenient to critical, depending on the service. In the end we've had to restrict our node scaling to avoid this issue, which goes against the whole ethos of Kubernetes. We're also provisioning bigger nodes than we need to avoid scaling out, which can be suboptimal.  We're now working with the vendors to get a more flexible license that bills per node on demand, but this is something to keep in mind when choosing a SaaS offering. Try to factor in the future scaling needs of your platform when purchasing SaaS services.

Let's imagine we now have tens of teams and hundreds of applications in the Argo UI. When we start scaling out to more than a handful of users we get into some issues with scale. Examples of these issues can be:  How do you organize your apps and projects?How do you make sure no two teams accidentally (or maliciously) use the same namespace?How can we make sure teams clean up unused deployment resources?How do you seamlessly deploy to multiple clusters?  As a platform team we often find ourselves thinking that everyone loves infrastructure and Kubernetes as much as we do. This is not the case! Most people have not had the joy of having their childhood ruined by installing Linux on their school laptops and configuring WLAN drivers using ndiswrapper. Believe it or not, most people just want tools to get out of their way and let them do their job, be that programming, testing or anything else. Not every team is going to be experts in Kubernetes and Argo. So should we expect all teams to know what a deletion finalizer is? What about the intricacies of serverside apply vs. clientside apply?  It's our responsibility as a platform team to make the user experience of deploying to Kubernetes as user friendly as possible. After implementing an architecture built with UX in mind we've had the joy of seeing people who are extremely skeptical of Kubernetes and the cloud be won over by how easy it is to get your workloads running on Kubernetes. This is thanks to the consistent user experience and built-in best practices of the apps-repo architecture. But we're getting ahead of ourselves, first we need to talk about a few abstractions that make this possible.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"What are ApplicationSets?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Scaling with Argo CD: Introducing the Apps Repo Architecture","url":"/blog/introducing-apps-repositories#what-are-applicationsets","content":" In Argo CD there's an advanced feature that allows for automating creation of Argo CD Applications calledApplicationSets. Using an ApplicationSet we can essentially make a template that generates Argo CD applications based on files or folders in a Git repository, sort of like a ReplicaSet for Pods. Using ApplicationSets we can build in features and assumptions and provide the teams with a user experience that essentially boils down to &quot;add a file to a repo and it gets deployed to the cluster&quot;. The purest form of GitOps. No messing around with Argo CD applications and projects.  A core Argo CD component called the ApplicationSet controller will detect anyApplicationSet resources deployed to the cluster and read them. After this, it will periodically scan the a repo configured in the ApplicationSet resource and generate Application resources, which in turn scan a repo for manifest files and sync them to the cluster. So in other words: ApplicationSet -&gt;Application -&gt; Deployments  For this to work you need a Git repo containing manifest files. You could have the teams put these manifest files into their source code repositories, but this is not considered best practice. Usually you would put your manifests into a separate repo so that changes to the manifests don't conflict with changes in the source code. At Kartverket we call this manifest repo an apps repo.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Introducing apps repositories​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Scaling with Argo CD: Introducing the Apps Repo Architecture","url":"/blog/introducing-apps-repositories#introducing-apps-repositories","content":"   The apps repo is where the product teams put their manifests. It has a consistent structure and is designed to be read by an Argo CD ApplicationSet. It also has a lot of nifty features that enable self-service which we'll get back to.  First, let's have a look at the structure of an apps repo.  teamname-apps/ env/ clustername/ namespace/ example.yaml   In the simplest of terms, this tree describes where to deploy a given manifest. By using a directory tree it makes setting up an ApplicationSet for this repo trivial.  Consider this example ApplicationSet:  apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind: ApplicationSet metadata: name: exampleteam-apps namespace: argocd spec: generators: - git: directories: - path: env/*/* repoURL: 'https://github.com/kartverket/exampleteam-apps.git' revision: HEAD goTemplate: true goTemplateOptions: - missingkey=error template: metadata: name: '{{.path.basename}}' spec: destination: namespace: '{{ index .path.segments 2 }}' name: '{{ index .path.segments 1 }}' project: exampleteam source: path: '{{.path.path}}' repoURL: 'https://github.com/kartverket/exampleteam-apps.git' targetRevision: HEAD syncPolicy: syncOptions: - CreateNamespace=true automated: prune: true allowEmpty: true selfHeal: true   With this ApplicationSet any directory within env/*/* will be picked up by the ApplicationSet controller and a new Argo CD Application will be created based on the template in the template object. This enables a product team to create any number of applications for their products.    An example use for this is a product team wanting a namespace for each of their products. Instead of having to order a new namespace from the platform team when they create a new product, they can simply create it themselves by adding a new directory with the same name as the namespace they want. A new Kubernetes namespace will be automatically created thanks to theCreateNamespace=true sync option.  Ephemeral namespaces, aka. preview namespaces, is another usecase. Say a team wants to review a change before merging it to main. They could review the change in the Pull Request, but this removes us from the end user's perspective and is not suitable for non-technical people. With a preview environment the team will automatically create a new directory in the apps repo when a PR is created, and thus get a complete deployment with the change in question. This enables end-to-end testing in a browser, and also allows non-technical people to do QA before a change is merged. When it is merged another workflow can automatically delete the directory, which cleans up and deletes the preview environment.  Our convention is that namespaces are formatted with productname-branch. This allows teams to have multiple deploys per product, and also multiple products per team. So when a new PR is created all a team needs to do to automate the creation of a new directory using CI tools like GitHub actions to create a new commit in the apps-repo. This also enables the flexibility to create it as a PR in the apps-repo, but for ephemeral namespaces, this is usually not necessary.  For example:  footeam-apps/ env/ foo-cluster/ foo-main/ app.yaml foo-feature-123/ app.yaml   ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Automating and avoiding duplication​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Scaling with Argo CD: Introducing the Apps Repo Architecture","url":"/blog/introducing-apps-repositories#automating-and-avoiding-duplication","content":" Depending on the complexity of the apps repo, the amount of products and branches and a subjective &quot;ickyness&quot; with duplicating files (can you spell DRY?), you have several options on how to automate creating new namespaces.  Simple repos will probably be fine with directories containing simple yaml-files that are synced to the cluster. Newer product teams especially appreciate the simplicity of this approach. To optimize for this you may consider using atemplate directory at the base containing some example files that are copied into the sub-directories. A pseudo-coded GitHub action that uses afrontend.yaml template from the templates directory could look like the following:  jobs: build: # Build a container image and push it deploy: strategy: matrix: env: ['dev', 'test', 'prod'] steps: # .. Checkout repo &amp; other setup .. - name: Deploy to ${{ matrix.version }} run: | namespace=&quot;myapp-${{ github.ref_name }}&quot; path=&quot;./env/atkv3-${{ matrix.env }}/$namespace&quot; mkdir -p $path cp -r templates/frontend.yaml $path/frontend.yaml kubectl patch --local \\ -f $path/frontend.yaml \\ -p '{&quot;spec&quot;:{&quot;image&quot;:&quot;${{needs.build.outputs.container_image_tag}}&quot;}}' \\ -o yaml git config --global user.email &quot;github-actions@github.com&quot; git config --global user.name &quot;GitHub Actions&quot; git commit -am &quot;Deploy ${{ matrix.env }} version ${{ github.ref_name }}&quot; git push   This works for most simple apps. Our experience, however, is that as a team matures and gets more experienced with Kubernetes and Argo CD, they add more complexity and want more control. At this point most teams will migrate to usingjsonnet to enable referencing and extending a reusable library shared between multiple components. SKIP also provides some common manifests via ArgoKit, a jsonnet library.  Kustomize is also a common choice, widely used by SKIP for our own infrastructure, but not really widespread with other teams.  Despite Argo supporting Helm we mostly avoid using it to create reusable templates due to the complexity of templating YAML. Jsonnet is superior in this regard.

Second, Argo CD has some great features we can leverage to make this work without removing the self-service nature of the apps repo architecture.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Prefixes​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Scaling with Argo CD: Introducing the Apps Repo Architecture","url":"/blog/introducing-apps-repositories#prefixes","content":" In order to make this work we need to give each team a set of prefixes. A prefix will usually be the name of a product that a product team has responsibility for maintaining. The only important part is that it is unique and that no other teams have been allocated the same prefix. At Kartverket this is done by the platform team as part of the team onboarding process.  The prefix is used as part of all namespaces that are created by the teams. In the example namespace product-feature-123, product is the prefix. By giving each team a set of prefixes it helps them separate products into easily identifiable namespaces and it ensures that a product team does not accidentally use another team's namespace.  Since each product team has an apps repo with the ability to name their directories as they wish, how can we enforce this? This is where Argo CD's Projects come into play.  Argo CD Projectsprovide a logical grouping of applications, which is useful when Argo CD is used by multiple teams. It also contains a field that allows allowlisting which clusters and namespaces are usable by a project.  Add the following to a Project to only allow this project to create and sync to namespaces prefixed with myprefix-.  metadata: name: exampleteam spec: destinations: - namespace: 'myprefix-*' server: '*'   If you scroll back up to the ApplicationSet example above, you will see that it only creates applications with the project exampleteam. This will automatically wire any applications created to the destination rules we've defined in this project and therefore deny any attempts by a team to use prefixes that they have not been allocated.  The crucial part here is that ApplicationSets and Projects are provisioned by the platform team, and therefore build in these security features. These resources must not be accessible to the teams, or an attacker can simply add exclusions.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Namespace resources​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Scaling with Argo CD: Introducing the Apps Repo Architecture","url":"/blog/introducing-apps-repositories#namespace-resources","content":" Another way this could be abused is if a team is able to create Namespace resources in their apps repository. This should be denied using Argo and/or cluster policies.  If a team is able to create namespace resources (or other cluster scoped resources) in their namespace an attacker can use this to break their namespace &quot;encapsulation&quot;. Imagine for example if one could use their apps repo to sync a namespace resource named kube-system into their env/foo-cluster/foo-maindirectory. Argo CD would allow this, as the manifests are read into an Argo CD application. Then the attacker could delete the namespace and take down the cluster.    It's useful in this multi-tenancy scenario to think of namespaces as resources owned by the platform team and namespace-scoped resources as owned by the product teams. This is considered a best practice, and was reiterated at KubeCon Europe 2024 by Marco De Benedictis. Allowing product teams to edit namespaces can open up a ton of attack vectors, like disabling Pod Security Admissioncontrollers, allowing an attacker to create privileged containers which can compromise the host node.  Friends don't let friends edit namespaces!  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Self service customization​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Scaling with Argo CD: Introducing the Apps Repo Architecture","url":"/blog/introducing-apps-repositories#self-service-customization","content":" So we set up an ApplicationSet that configures best practices and secure defaults for product teams! Great! But now that team with experienced cloud engineers really wants to customize their Argo configuration. Maybe they want to configure that one app has auto sync on, but another app has it turned off. Maybe they want to disable self-healing for a short period to manually edit in the cluster. In any case, how can we let teams change this configuration self-service when applications are provisioned by theApplicationSet resource?  We could let the teams edit the ApplicationSet. In our case this would mean the teams need to learn about the ApplicationSet abstraction, gotemplate and SKIP's internal GitOps repo structure. This is overkill when a team usually just wants to flip a flag between true or false for a directory. There could also be security implications with allowing teams to edit ApplicationSet resources that could break encapsulation, which we want to avoid.  Another option would be to contact the platform team and tell us to change some config for them. This is not in line with our thinking, as we want the teams to be able to work autonomously for most operations like this. It would also mean we were given a lot of menial tasks which would mean we have less time to do other more meaningful things or become a bottleneck for the teams.  A third option is setting the ApplicationSet sync policy to create-only. This would confifure the ApplicationSet controller to create Application resources, but prevent any further modification, such as deletion, or modification of Application fields. This would allow a team to edit the application in the UI after creation, for example disabling auto sync. This last option is user friendly, but in violation of GitOps principles where config lives in git and not in a database. If you run Argo stateless like we do this would also mean the changes disappear when the pod restarts.  Because none of these options seemed to be the best, we created a better solution. By using a combination of generators and the new template patchfeature in Argo CD 2.8 we can look through every directory in the apps repo for a configuration file called config.json.  Let's look at an example config.json file. This example file is commited in the apps repo to the env/foo-cluster/foo-main directory.  { &quot;tool&quot;: &quot;kustomize&quot;, &quot;autoSync&quot;: false }   This file is not required, but if this file is found the values configured there overrides a set of default values in the ApplicationSet template. These flags are then used to determine how the resulting Application will behave. This means the team is able to change the values they care about per directory of their apps repo  footeam-apps/ env/ foo-cluster/ foo-main/ config.json app.yaml foo-feature-123/ config.json app.yaml foo-feature-with-default-config/ app.yaml   Additionaly, since the platform team is in control of the template we can eliminate the ability to maliciously change the template by parsing the inputs in a secure way.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Example ApplicationSet​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Scaling with Argo CD: Introducing the Apps Repo Architecture","url":"/blog/introducing-apps-repositories#example-applicationset","content":" Let's look at how we can write an ApplicationSet that allows us to useconfig.json files.  First, we need to configure the ApplicationSet to look through all directories, and at the same time use a config.json file if it is found. This is perhaps the least intuitive part of this new ApplicationSet, so let's walk through it step by step.  First we create a merge generator, which will merge two generators. The key thing here is that it only merges if the key matches in both generators, so this allows us to first find all directories (the default), then directories that contain config.json files (the override).   generators: - merge: generators: - # default - # override mergeKeys: - key   Now we're going to add the generator from before into the default. The only difference is we're doing this using a matrix generator. Doing this combines the parameters generated by the two child generators, which gives us the values from the git generator like before, but also a set of default values we can use in our template later if the config.json file is not provided.  We're also using a value from the git generator to assign a key that will uniquely identify this directory for the merge generator later.   generators: - merge: generators: - matrix: generators: - git: directories: - path: env/*/* repoURL: 'https://github.com/kartverket/exampleteam-apps.git' revision: HEAD - list: elements: - allowEmpty: false autoSync: true key: '{{ .path.basenameNormalized}}' prune: true selfHeal: true tool: directory - # override mergeKeys: - key   Now we use a variant of the git generator to find all config.json files in the same repo and extract the values from it. Again we're using the key field to uniquely identify this directory so that it will be merged with the correct directory in the merge generator.  We're repeating the default values here as well, since not all fields are required and we don't want them to be overwritten as null in the resulting merge.   generators: - merge: generators: - matrix: generators: - git: directories: - path: env/*/* repoURL: 'https://github.com/kartverket/exampleteam-apps.git' revision: HEAD - list: elements: - allowEmpty: false autoSync: true key: '{{ .path.basenameNormalized}}' prune: true selfHeal: true tool: directory - matrix: generators: - git: files: - path: env/*/*/config.json repoURL: 'https://github.com/kartverket/exampleteam-apps.git' revision: HEAD - list: elements: - allowEmpty: false autoSync: true key: '{{ .path.basenameNormalized}}' prune: true selfHeal: true tool: directory mergeKeys: - key   That's it for the generator! Now we can use these variables in thetemplatePatch field (and other fields). In this case we want to set syncPolicy options, so we need to use the templatePatch, as gotemplates don't work for objects.  We're also adding a special case where for directory sources (the default) we exclude config.json files, as we don't want to sync the config file with Argo. This allows us to extend it later to add options for other tools like Kustomize or Helm.  Keep in mind that we don't want users to inject maliciously formed patches, so we cast booleans to booleans.   templatePatch: | spec: source: directory: {{- if eq .tool &quot;directory&quot; }} exclude: config.json {{- end }} {{- if .autoSync }} syncPolicy: automated: allowEmpty: {{ .allowEmpty | toJson }} prune: {{ .prune | toJson }} selfHeal: {{ .selfHeal | toJson }} {{- end }}   ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Complete ApplicationSet​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Scaling with Argo CD: Introducing the Apps Repo Architecture","url":"/blog/introducing-apps-repositories#complete-applicationset","content":" Here is a complete ApplicationSet containing all the features we've discussed so far.  apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind: ApplicationSet metadata: name: exampleteam-apps namespace: argocd spec: generators: - merge: generators: - matrix: generators: - git: directories: - path: env/*/* repoURL: 'https://github.com/kartverket/exampleteam-apps.git' revision: HEAD - list: elements: - allowEmpty: false autoSync: true key: '{{ .path.basenameNormalized}}' prune: true selfHeal: true tool: directory - matrix: generators: - git: files: - path: env/*/*/config.json repoURL: https://github.com/kartverket/exampleteam-apps.git revision: HEAD - list: elements: - allowEmpty: false autoSync: true key: '{{ .path.basenameNormalized}}' prune: true selfHeal: true tool: directory mergeKeys: - key goTemplate: true goTemplateOptions: - missingkey=error template: metadata: name: '{{.path.basenameNormalized}}' spec: destination: namespace: '{{ index .path.segments 2 }}' name: '{{ index .path.segments 1 }}' project: exampleteam source: path: '{{.path.path}}' repoURL: 'https://github.com/kartverket/exampleteam-apps.git' targetRevision: HEAD syncPolicy: managedNamespaceMetadata: labels: app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: argocd pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit: restricted team: exampleteam syncOptions: - CreateNamespace=true - ServerSideApply=true - PrunePropagationPolicy=background templatePatch: | spec: source: directory: {{- if eq .tool &quot;directory&quot; }} exclude: config.json {{- end }} {{- if .autoSync }} syncPolicy: automated: allowEmpty: {{ .allowEmpty | toJson }} prune: {{ .prune | toJson }} selfHeal: {{ .selfHeal | toJson }} {{- end }}   ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Results​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Scaling with Argo CD: Introducing the Apps Repo Architecture","url":"/blog/introducing-apps-repositories#results","content":" With Argo CD and the apps repo architecture, we've seen some real improvements in our deploy system. Teams find it to be incredibly intuitive to just update a file in Git and have it be instantly reflected in Argo CD and Kubernetes, especially when combined with Argo CD auto-sync.  Onboarding new teams is quick and easy, since just putting files into a Git repo is something most developers are already familiar with. We just show them the structure of the apps repo and they're good to go. A team can go from not having any experience with Kubernetes to deploying their first application in a matter of minutes.  Migrating from one cluster to another is also a breeze. Just move manifests from one directory under env to another, and the ApplicationSet will take care of the rest. This is especially useful for teams that want to start developing with new cloud native principles on-premises, modernizing the application and eventually moving to the cloud.  I feel the key part of this architecture is the config.json file. It allows a degree of customization that is not possible with the default ApplicationSettemplate and was to us the last missing piece. It allows teams to change configuration without needing to know about the ApplicationSet abstraction, and it allows the platform team to enforce security and best practices.

Like always, it's tradeoffs all the way down.  Since a product team uses an apps repo to organize their apps, moving apps from one team to another will require migrating files from one repo to another. This will require some manual work to prevent Argo deleting the entire namespace when the directory is removed from the old repo. Usually this is not a big issue, and moving projects between teams happens very rarely, but it's something to keep in mind.  There is also a risk that a team could accidentally delete a namespace by removing a directory in the apps repo. We have mitigated this by disabling auto-sync for most mission critical applications in production.  And finally, projects that don't have clear ownership or shared ownership can be tricky to place into a repo. You could make an apps repo for a &quot;pseudo-team&quot; consisting of the teams that need access, but generally we find that it's better that all products have a clear singular main owner.

GitOps er beskrevet i bildet over og er en “Pull-basert” deployment-flyt kontra den tradisjonelle “Push-baserte” deployment-flyten. En operator kjører i clusteret og overvåker kontinuerlig ett eller flere git-repoet og synker yaml-filer inn i clusteret. På den måten kan produktteam forholde seg til noe så enkelt som filer i en mappe i git, og når disse filene endres gjøres en deploy helt automatisk.  GitOps vil gi mange fordeler, men det blir et paradigmeskifte for mange. Istedenfor å tenke “Push”-basert deploy ved å kjøre et skript for å deploye vil man legge inn ønsket state i en fil og så vil systemet jobbe for å bringe clusteret i synk med ønsket state. Denne overgangen kan også sammenlignes litt med imperativ vs. deklarativ programmering, som jQuery vs. React. For de fleste som har jobbet med Kubernetes vil det føles veldig kjent, siden Kubernetes i praksis er en stor reconciliation loop som kontinuerlig driver clusteret mot ønsket state.  Det er mange fordeler med et slikt deployment-system. Når deployment og CI er to distinktive komponenter i systemet blir deployment-systemet mye mer spisset inn mot sin rolle og vil kunne perfeksjonere den, den såkalte “Do one thing and do it well”-tankegangen.

Apps-repoer har kun metadata om applikasjonen i form av manifest-filer. Dette kan man også lese om i Best Practices for Argo CD.  Dette gjør at man får et tydelig skille mellom kildekoderepoer og apps-repoer. Kildekoderepoer har ansvaret for å lagre kode, bygge artefakter og container-imager. Apps-repoer beskriver den ønskede staten til applikasjonen på clusteret og Argo jobber mot å bringe clusteret i synk med denne staten. Dette gjør det også enkelt å forholde seg til apps-repoene som en “single source of truth” til applikasjonsstaten på clusteret.

Hvordan kan man gjøre dette med Argo CD?  Ved hvert push til et kildekoderepo kjøres et bygg for å bygge et byggartefakt og bygge et container image. Så snart dette imaget er pushet til et registry som ghcr.io vil man at dette skal legges ut på clusteret, og da må man oppdatere manifest-filene i apps-repoet. Man kan oppdatere disse filene manuelt for å trigge en synk, men det er også mulig å gjøre dette automatisk som en del av samme pipeline.  Etter imaget er publisert til ghcr.io puller bygget apps-repoet ved å bruke https://github.com/actions/checkout. Deretter endres filene til å inneholde referansen til det nye imaget, og disse filene commites lokalt. Hvordan disse filene endres er opp til produktteamet, men et forslag ligger i Automation from CI Pipelines. Til slutt pushes filene til repoet som vil trigge en synk med de oppdaterte manifestene.  Dette kan også gjøres med en PR istedenfor å pushe rett til apps-repoet om man vil ha en godkjenning før deploy.  For å logge inn på apps-repoet brukes metoden som beskrives i Tilgang til repoer med tokens fra GitHub Actions.  info Dersom man bruker Argo CD til å opprette namespacer for alle branches og pull requests er det viktig å slette branchene når de ikke lenger er i bruk. Det er begrenset med kapasitet på clusterene og å anskaffe hardware, både on-prem og i sky, er ekstremt kostbart. Det holder å slette filene i apps-repoet for å rydde opp, noe som kan gjøres automatisk ved sletting av branches.

I Kartverket brukes ofte Jsonnet, et konfigurasjonsspråk som utvider JSON med funksjoner, uttrykk og mulighet for gjenbruk. Jsonnet reduserer duplisering og gjør komplekse manifest enklere å vedlikeholde.  ArgoKit tilbyr et sett med gjenbrukbare Jsonnet-maler (bibliotek) som gjør det raskere og mer konsistent å definere Skiperator-applikasjoner.

Der kan man velge fra et eksisterende bibliotek med eksempler på Actions som kan hjelpe med å komme i gang med en action. For eksempel kan man trykke “View all” på “Continous Integration” for å finne eksempler på hvordan man bygger med java eller node.js. DIsse er ofte gode utgangspunkt når man skal sette opp et nytt bygg.  Les https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions for en introduksjon til Actions.  Se https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions for referanse av mulige verdier.

Dette kan gjøres enkelt ved hjelp av GitHub Actions.  Se denne artikkelen for mer informasjon om ghcr: https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry .  Eksempler for publisering av container images til GitHub finnes her .  Dersom dere bruker metoden over vil dere merke at dere ikke trenger å sette tags på docker imaget dere bygger. Dette vil settes automatisk basert på en “sane default” ut i fra hvilke branch man er på og hvilke kontekst bygget gjøres i (commit, PR, tag). De resulterende taggene er dokumentert her . Tags kan også tilpasses om ikke default er passende for prosjektet.  Resultatet blir å finne på GitHub repositoriet til koden og ser slik ut:    Det er anbefalt å kjøre skannere på images som bygges før de deployes. Da vil sårbarheter kunne vises i Utviklerportalen.

The operator is designed to be used by application developers to deploy their applications and jobs into a Kubernetes cluster. It will create all the necessary resources for the application to run, such as deployments, services, and ingress resources, and also handle security aspects like setting up network policies and service accounts so you as a developer don't have to worry about it. Logs and metrics will be automatically available on monitoring.kartverket.cloud Skiperator offers three CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) to make it easy to deploy applications and jobs into a Kubernetes cluster: Application - for deploying applicationsSKIPJob - for running jobs and cron jobsRouting - for setting up routing rules, for example frontend and backend services under the same domain To get started check out the Requirements and Getting started pages.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Manifester","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/applikasjon-utrulling/skipctl/manifests","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Globalt​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Manifester","url":"/docs/applikasjon-utrulling/skipctl/manifests#globalt","content":" Felles for alle manifest-kommandoer.

Etter å ha fullført opprettelsen, vil Azurerator opprette en Kubernetes-hemmelighet (Secret) i samme namespace med hemmeligheter som kan brukes av applikasjoner til tilgangsstyring, som for eksempel client_id, client_secret, private_key_jwt, diverse URL-er og lignende.  tip Azurerator håndterer rullering av hemmeligheter for deg! Hemmeligheten som Azurerator oppretter vil ha to sett med client_id og private_key_jwt: ett aktivt og ett neste. Når det aktive settet nærmer seg utløp, vil Azurerator automatisk generere et nytt sett og oppdatere app-registreringen i Entra ID.  spec (object, required) – Spesifikasjon til AzureAdApplication allowAllUsers (bool, required) – Bestemmer om alle brukere i tenanten som Azurerator er konfigurert mot skal få tilgang. claims (object, optional) – Definerer konfigurasjon av claims som inkluderes i tokenene som returneres til Entra ID applikasjonen. groups ([]object, optional) – En liste over Entra ID gruppe ID-er som skal inkluderes i groups-claimet i tokenene utstedt av Entra ID. Dette tildeler også grupper til app-registreringen brukt for tilgangskontroll. Kun direkte medlemmer av gruppene får tilgang. id (string, required) – Objekt-ID-en (OID) til en Entra ID-gruppe. replyUrls ([]object, required) – URL-er som applikasjonen godtar som svaradresser etter autentisering. url (string, required) – En godkjent svaradresse (reply URL) for applikasjonen. logoutUrl (string, optional) – URL-en brukere blir omdirigert til når de logger ut av applikasjonen.. preAuthorizedApplications ([]object, optional) – Definerer andre app-registreringer som er forhåndsautorisert til å få tilgang til denne applikasjonen.

Følgende eksempel oppretter app-registreringen atgcp1-sandbox:tilgangsstyring-main:test-app. Den gir kun tilgang til direkte medlemmer av gruppene med objekt-ID 4bdc77ce-2a99-406c-a07e-88a1eba82dd9 eller 1262b1c5-d2db-44ad-96e3-ed8637e6b996. Den forhåndsautoriserer også app-registration med navn atgcp1-dev:other-namespace:other-app. Når registrering er fullført vil Azurerator opprette Kubernetes-hemmeligheten entraid-secret i namespacet tilgangsstyring-main.  Hvis denne klientregistreringen skal brukes sammen med Ztoperator for å beskytte din applikasjon og eventuelt logge inn brukere, så er det et par felt som må konfigureres riktig.  spec.replyUrls må samsvare med spec.ingresses i din Skiperator-Application og spec.autoLogin.redirectPath i din Ztoperator-AuthPolicy.spec.logoutUrl må matche spec.ingresses i din Skiperator-Application.spec.secretName må matche spec.oAuthCredentials i Ztoperator-AuthPolicy.spec.singlePageApplication må være satt til false ettersom Ztoperator ikke gjennomfører innloggingsflyten i en offentlig klient.

En annen ting å merke seg er at Ztoperator ikke har lov til å laste inn hemmeligheter som brukes for innlogging i den beskyttede applikasjonen. For å løse dette er man nødt til å legge til en konfigurasjon på den beskyttede Skiperator-applikasjonen for at innloggingshemligheter som Ztoperator håndterer skal kunne lastes inn. Følgende eksempel viser hvordan dette kan gjøres i en Skiperator-applikasjon.

Det finnes mange måter å konfigurere disse på, alt i fra helt egenlagde endepunkter til ferdige rammeverk som eksponerer dette automatisk.  I hovedsak finnes det tre typer prober som kubernetes opererer med:  Liveness probe - Sjekker om containeren kjører og fungerer, hvis ikke så restarter kubernetes containeren    Readiness probe - Brukes for å bestemme om en pod en klar for å ta i mot trafikk. En pod er klar når alle containere i poden er klare.    Startup probe - Hvis denne er konfigurert så avventer kubernetes med liveness og readiness til dette endepunktet svarer. Dette kan brukes for å gi trege containere noe mer tid til å starte opp.  Det finnes flere måter å sette opp helsesjekker på, som f.eks. kommandoer, HTTP-requests, TCP-requests og gRPC-requests. Den aller vanligste måten er å konfigurere et endepunkt (f.eks /health, /liveness) i applikasjonen som svarer på HTTP-requests, og spesifisere dette som en del av pod-spesifikasjonen.  Litt mer om helsesjekker generelt: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/  Det er viktig å merke seg at man ikkemåbenytte seg av alle disse helsesjekkene, men man bør ta et bevisst valg om det er hensiktsmessig eller ikke.

Når man starter opp en Spring-applikasjon i kubernetes vil Spring Boot Actuator også automatisk tilgjengeliggjøre /actuator/health/liveness og /actuator/health/readiness som man benytte for helsesjekker.

Requests er hvor mye CPU og minne hvercontainerspør om når den først settes på en node. Hvis man for eksempel ber om 500 mCPUer, men noden bare har 250 mCPU ledig, kan containeres ikke kjøres på den noden.  Merk at man kan spesifisere CPU helt ned i millicpuer (mCPU).  Minne-requests kan settes i mange forskjellige enheter, se dokumentasjonen for detaljer. Vi anbefaler dog at man holder seg til M - megabytes.  Limits er hvor mye ressurser en container maksimalt får lov til å bruke. Dette er med andre ord noe som settes for å forhindre at en container med en bug tar over alle ressursene, og gjør det umulig for andre containere å skalere.  Vi anbefaler at du ser på Limiten som en mulighet til å finne bugs og memory leaks. Sett den så lavt du er komfortabel med, og følg med på det faktiske forbruket. Hvis noe kræsjer er det da god sjanse for at det ble innført en bug.  Dersom det faktiske forbruket nærmer seg limiten på grunn av naturlige grunner - flere requests eller tyngre load+ er det på tide å øke limiten. Ikke vent til appliasjonen kræsjer - det skaper en dårlig brukeropplevelse.  tip En god tommelfingerregel for requests og limits er følgende: For minne bør man profilere applikasjonens gjennomsnittlige minnebruk og doble denne som limit. For CPU trenger man ikke limit, men heller definere en fornuftig request.  Logikken bak dette er at dersom en applikasjon bruker altfor mye minne kan det føre til at andre applikasjoner går ned. Dersom en applikasjon bruker mye CPU fører det derimot bare i verste fall til at ting går tregere.  Dette er reglene for ressursbruk i Kubernetes på SKIP  Produktteamet velger selv hva som er naturlig ressursbruk for sine containere, og skal ha et bevisst forhold til hvilke grenser som er satt. Produktteamet skal følge med på ressursbruken over tid, og oppdatere grensene slik at de til enhver tid reflekterer hva applikasjonen faktisk trenger. Resource requests og limits skal settes på alle containere slik at det blir tydelig hva som er forventet ressursbruk. Resource limits skal skal alltid settes høyere enn requests, men aldri unaturlig høyt. Husk at dette fungerer både som dokumentasjon og som en sikring mot bugs og feilkonfigurasjon. Resource limits skal aldri fjernes permanent, men kan fjernes for debugging. Da skal SKIP-teamet gjøres oppmerksom på dette. Godt blogginnlegg om korrelasjonen mellom JVMs og Kubernetes’ minnebruk  Kubernetes’ dokumentasjon om ressursbruk  Google Clouds dokumentasjon om “cost effective apps” (Merk at Google anbefaler å sette limit til det samme som requests - vi setter driftsstabilitet over kostnad, og er derfor uenig i dette.)

Standardoppførselen skal i utgangspunktet være sikker, med mulighet for produktteamene å overstyre der det gir mening for deres applikasjon. Dette er kort fortalt hvordan SKIP balanserer behovet for sikkerhet med autonomi. Et eksempel på dette er prinsippet om Zero Trust i nettverkslaget. All trafikk på Kubernetes er i utgangspunktet stengt, en pod kan ikke snakke med en hvilken som helst annen. Kun om begge tjenestene åpner for at de kan snakke med hverandre kan trafikken flyte mellom dem. Dette gjør produktteamene selv ved å sette accessPolicy i sitt Skiperator-manifest. All trafikk mellom podder i Kubernetes er kryptert med mTLS helt automatisk. Det eneste man trenger å gjøre er å sende spørringer til en annen pod, så krypterer Service Meshet koblingen automatisk. Dersom man trenger å eksponere applikasjonen sin til omverdenen kan man konfigurere et endepunkt som applikasjonen skal eksponeres på. Når dette er konfigurert får man utstedt et gyldig sertifikat som gjør at all trafikk krypteres med HTTPS helt automatisk. Dette sertifikatet fornyes også automatisk.

The grafana-alerts repo is designed to be a repo that contains the alerts of all teams and handles deployment of alerts to Grafana. You will get a file which contains the configuration of your alerts in a Terraform format. For example, the file could look like this:  resource &quot;grafana_folder&quot; &quot;MYTEAMNAME_folder&quot; { for_each = local.envs title = &quot;Alerts MYTEAMNAME ${each.key}&quot; } module &quot;MYTEAMNAME_alerts_kubernetes&quot; { source = &quot;../modules/grafana_alert_group&quot; for_each = local.envs name = &quot;kube-state-metrics&quot; env = each.value runbook_base_url = # URL to document describing each alert folder_uid = grafana_folder.MYTEAMNAME_folder[each.key].uid team = { name = &quot;MYTEAMNAME&quot; } alerts = { KubernetesPodNotHealthy = { summary = &quot;Kubernetes Pod not healthy (instance {{ $labels.instance }})&quot; description = &quot;Pod has been in a non-ready state for longer than 15 minutes.\\n VALUE = {{ $value }}\\n LABELS = {{ $labels }}&quot; severity = &quot;critical&quot; for = &quot;15m&quot; expr = &lt;&lt;EOT sum by (namespace, pod) (kube_pod_status_phase{phase=~&quot;Pending|Unknown|Failed&quot;, namespace=~&quot;nrl-.*&quot;}) EOT }, # ... more alerts } }   In the above file we create an alert that monitors the health of a pod in all nrl namespaces.

If you want to learn more about PromQL look at the documentation as well as some examples from the Prometheus documentation and the examples at awesome prometheus alerts .

Vaktlaget is a team consisting of various people in IT-drift that have a special agreement that allows them to be notified and follow up when an alert fires outside of normal working hours.  The first step for getting your alerts onboarded onto vaktlaget is to maintain a set of alerts that only fire when there is a serious outage. Keep in mind that an alert that fires will potentially wake people in the middle of the night, so it is paramount that this set of alerts don’t contain non-critical or “flaky” alerts. These alerts should be given a severity of “critical” to make them distinct from other alerts.  Once you have done this you need to contact vaktlaget to discuss the alerts you wish to onboard.

After you’ve discussed with vaktlaget you can contact SKIP in #gen-skip to have your alert integration be switched over. When this is done, all alerts labeled with env=prod and severity=critical will be sent to vaktlaget using the following schedule:  The alerts will be sent to your slack channel all dayThe alerts will be sent to appdrift as email, SMS and phone call between 7 and 22The alerts will be sent to infrastrukturdrift as email, SMS and phone call between 22 and 7  You can also create a pull request in grafana-alerts with the vaktlag escalation chain added to your integration:  module &quot;skip&quot; { source = &quot;../modules/oncall_integration&quot; integration_name = &quot;skip&quot; slack_channel_name = &quot;grafana-oncall&quot; //Not required, replace with your own vaktlag_enabled = true vaktlag_escalation_chain_id = module.vaktlag.appdrift_escalation_chain_id default_escalation_chain_id = module.skip.team_escalation_chain_id }   When you later add more alerts to the critical level you also need to discuss with vaktlaget so they can sign off on the new alerts before they are added.

Some of these are interlinked or trigger each other. In order to find out which operations that originate from the same request, it is common in many systems to have a so-called Trace ID.

This means that all Prometheus scrapes (metrics collection) and automatic health checks will also be collected. Now that issue #4628has been implemented, this can finally be rectified. Follow SKIP-1250 for updates to when this is implemented in our setup.  In order to generate, propagate and send traces the application must be instrumented.  Instrumentation can be achieved in several ways, of which 2 are relevant to us: manual and automatic instrumentation.  Manual instrumentation requires the use of a library which knows how a given integration behaves, and which enables it to connect to hooks in that integrations in order to generate new traces and/or spans if those do not already exist.  The other (and recommended) method is to use an automated approach. In the case of Java applications (the only type that has been tested as of now), you will need to bundle a java agent in your Docker image, as well as set up some extra configuration when the application is run (for example through Skiperator).  info It’s worth mentioning that the Spring ecosystem offers a form of automatic instrumentation via Micrometer Tracing and OpenTelemetry OTLP exporters. Per october 2023 this is still under development and not considered a mature enough solution to utilize in our systems.

For eksempel, dersom max_connections-variabelen i Terraform-modulen er satt til 100, og man har to applikasjoner som hver bruker 30 connections og kjører med to replikas, vil det totalt bli 120 connections – i tillegg til noen system-connections (typisk 2–3).  I slike tilfeller kan instansen bli utilgjengelig: man kan verken restarte den eller gjøre konfigurasjonsendringer.  Løsning: Skaler ned alle applikasjoner (sett replicas til 0), og vent opptil én time. Når connections er frigjort, kan man justere max_connections-verdien.  Anbefaling: Implementer connection pooling i applikasjonene. Hver enkelt connection øker belastningen på databaseinstansen, og unødvendig høyt antall tilkoblinger er både ineffektivt og kostbart.

It is possible to include PII like name, IP or anything that is accessible from JavaScript in the SDK, but this is not done by default and requres calling the setUser function on the SDK.  A session ID is sent in to enable de-duplicating events like navigation between pages and ranking top users. This is a randomly generated string and is stored in the user’s browser SessionStorage. Note that even though this is not a cookie, this means a “cookie banner” is required as per the EU’s ePrivacy directive .  As SessionInstrumentation is included by default in the web instrumentation of the JavaScript SDK, disabling it requires invoking the SDK with instrumentations set and omitting the SessionInstrumentation function.  Data is stored on SKIP’s atgcp1-prod cluster, which stores data in Google Cloud Storage europe-north1 region. This region is located in Finland, and is thus within EU. This means no data leaves the EU’s borders which means the storage of the data is compliant with GDPR.
