SKIP is starting a tech blog! ðŸš€

Or call it a newsletter if you're tired of blogs ðŸ¤ª

Our first entry is already out, and it's about [why we chose
Anthos](/blog/hybrid-kubernetes-in-production-part-1) for hybrid cloud. We're
working on more entries into that series and other exciting topics, so stay
tuned!

# Huh? SKIP?

SKIP is Statens Kartverks Infrastruktur Plattform, or in English, the
Infrastructure Platform of the Norwegian Mapping Authority.

We're the platform team at [Kartverket](https://kartverket.no). We tame
Kubernetes and the Cloud. With SKIP, developers in Kartverket are empowered to
run, not walk, using a comprehensive toolbox of modern cloud technology. Using
SKIP, developers can deploy applications to Kubernetes in a matter of minutes,
while still being able to use the tools they know and love.

# Like what you see?

We're a small team, but we're growing fast. We're also hiring, so if you're
interested in working with us, check out our [open
positions](https://www.kartverket.no/en/about-kartverket/careers).
