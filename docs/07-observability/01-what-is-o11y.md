# What is Observability?

Observability refers to the ability to understand a system’s inner state based on its external output. This enables developers to diagnose problems and understand the system’s performance.

Observability is often achieved through logging, metrics and tracing. A high level of observability makes troubleshooting more efficient, and is critical for modern, distributed systems where traditional methods of troubleshooting may not be sufficient.
